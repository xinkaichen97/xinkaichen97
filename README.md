## Hi there 👋

Thanks for visiting! My name is Xinkai Chen, which is 陳辛楷 in Chinese.

### 📍 Current Role
I'm currently based in the lovely, windy city of Chicago. I'm a Data Scientist at [Elevance Health](https://www.elevancehealth.com/), striving to use my AI/ML knowledge to make healthcare easier and better for humanity.

### 👨🏻‍🎓 Education
I graduated from [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University in December 2020, with a Master's degree in Information Systems Management ([MISM](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-systems-management-master/)). 

Before that, I did my undergraduate at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en) in the School of Computer Science. 

### 🏡 Background
I was born and raised in Fuzhou, a beautiful coastal city in southeast China. It's been a while since I left, but I always dream of sharing its beauty with the world. I'm also a proud alumnus of Fuzhou No.1 Middle School.

### 📸 Interests
I love photography & videography for capturing and reliving the moments of my life. Check out my [Photography Website](https://www.xinkaiphotos.com) for some photos!
